# Heart Disease Prediction System Project

This project focuses on two main goals: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Predictive Modeling. The project aims to analyze a dataset to uncover trends, connections, and important components associated with heart disease. Furthermore, it aims to develop a desktop application that utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict a patient's risk of heart disease based on identified features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this phase, we delve into the dataset to extract meaningful insights regarding heart disease. Our objectives include:

- **Age Group Analysis:** Determine which age group exhibits the highest vulnerability or has a significant proportion of individuals at an elevated risk of experiencing a heart attack.
  
- **Gender Comparison:** Investigate whether there's a greater susceptibility to heart attacks among men compared to women.

- **Chest Pain Analysis:** Identify which types of chest pain are associated with an increased risk of a severe heart attack.

- **Fasting Blood Sugar Correlation:** Explore the correlation between fasting blood sugar levels and the likelihood of a heart attack.

- **Cholesterol Levels:** Analyze how cholesterol levels correlate with the risk of experiencing a heart attack.

We achieve these objectives through statistical summaries and visualizations, aiming to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

## Predictive Modeling

The predictive modeling aspect involves creating a desktop application that not only showcases descriptive measures but also employs machine learning algorithms to predict a patient's risk of heart disease. This process involves:

- **Feature Selection:** Identifying relevant features that contribute to the prediction of heart disease.

- **Model Development:** Utilizing machine learning algorithms such as regression or classification to develop a predictive model.

- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's generalizability and accuracy through rigorous testing and validation.

By taking a methodical approach, we aim to improve the model's accuracy and generalizability, making it a valuable tool for early identification of heart disease and efficient risk assessment.
