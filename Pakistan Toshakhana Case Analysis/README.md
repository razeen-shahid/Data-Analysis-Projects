# Pakistan Toshakhana Data Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the **Pakistan Toshakhana Data Analysis** project. In this repository, we delve into the allegations of former government officials obtaining expensive cars and other gifts from foreign visitors in Pakistan. These presents were preserved in a toshakhana, or treasure chest, and the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) was tasked with conducting an inquiry into the matter by the Pakistani Supreme Court in 2018.

This project aims to shed light on the following aspects:

- The nature and extent of the gifts received by former government officials.
- Whether these gifts were disclosed to the government and subjected to the necessary taxes.
- The legal and ethical implications of accepting such gifts.

## Project Description

The investigation revealed that former presidents, prime ministers, and other officials had received gifts worth millions of dollars without disclosing them to the government or paying the required taxes. This project seeks to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data associated with the Toshakhana case and the gifts in question.

## Tools Used
